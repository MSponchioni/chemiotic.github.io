## Mixing Module Project

The module is able to easily make a liquid solution of several components (up to 4 in this example) in a continous way. Basically, it solves the problem of accurately dosing some liquids (aqueous or organic) that can must be mutually soluble among themselves. Care is taken in order to avoid leakage (especially important in case of flammable fluids) and guarantee high productivity with a reduced investiment.
The module can be projected in two versions:
* fully manual version (low cost and easy setup);
* automatic and controlled version (higher cost).
